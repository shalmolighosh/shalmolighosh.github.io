## About Me
I am [Shalmoli Ghosh](in.linkedin.com/in/shalmoli-ghosh-1a81749b) PhD student in [Informatics](https://informatics.indiana.edu/) at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing & Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington. I am primarily supervised by [Prof. Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I am also a part of the [NaN](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan) research group and the [Observatory on Social Media](https://osome.iu.edu/). My current research focuses on how Generative AI is being used in text-to-image platforms to generate explicit content and deepfakes. I am also interested in finding out how the interactions between humans and LLMs are affecting the inherent psychological processes in humans.
